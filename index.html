      <p>I grew up in the food and beverage industry since the age of 14. I started out as a buser and dish washer and worked my way up to a cook.  after that I decided to learn all aspects of the job and became a server, host, and bar tender as well</p>

      <p>After highschool I went to college for Business Administration.  After earning my Associates Degree I got my first job in food and beverage mangement.  I spent 2 years at 54th Street Bar and Grill and then moved to HMS Host at KCI airport.  After 3 years of learning all concepts I settled in at Starbucks.</p>

      <p>Starbucks was in trouble and was about to get shut down.  At the time we had 5 stores and 26 associates.  After 6 months of hard work we came out of double default and opened 3 more stores and are currently the leading License Store in stores per passengers.</p>
